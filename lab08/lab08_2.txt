Exercise 8.2

a) 

    The Pearson Correlation Coeffient describes how closely the data fits a line.
    Values close to -1 or 1 show heavy Correlation as the best-fit line is very close to the data points
    Values close to 0 indicate no Correlation or random noise. 

    Population and Households have a PCC of 0.9, which makes sense as generally the 
        higher the population the more households exist to hold those extra people.
    Population and Population have a PCC of 1.0 because the data points match exactly since they are the same.

b)

    Task 1:

        minimal_features = [
                        "median_income",
                        "rooms_per_person"
        ]

        Final RMSE: 
            period 09 : 84.96
        
        Yes, I crushed the solution provided ( 113.27 ) because rooms_per_person is a better predictor than latitude


    Task 2:

        california_housing_dataframe["distance_from_sf"] = abs(california_housing_dataframe["latitude"] - 38)
        california_housing_dataframe["distance_from_la"] = abs(california_housing_dataframe["latitude"] - 34)

        minimal_features = [
            "median_income",
            "distance_from_sf",
            "distance_from_la"
        ]

        train_model(
            learning_rate=0.05,
            steps=500,
            batch_size=5,
            training_examples=minimal_training_examples,
            training_targets=training_targets,
            validation_examples=minimal_validation_examples,
            validation_targets=validation_targets)
