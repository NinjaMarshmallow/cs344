Exercise 8.4

a) K-folds are a good method of making a model more precise even on datasets 
    that are small or with validation sets that are small.
b) If a dataset varies wildly, it's more likely that any given validation set or 
    testing sets do not match the training set well, even if the model is relatively good.
c) Yes, it will avoid 'severe overfitting'
d) No, making it deeper does cause overfitting and making the network wider causes more noise and unreliability
