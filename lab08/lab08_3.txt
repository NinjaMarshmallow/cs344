Exercise 8.3

a) FTRL changes the learning rate on the fly. It raises or lowers it from the base level provided by the parameter
        according to the coefficients in use while training.

b) Binning is used for the same reason as the synthetic feature created last Exercise, distance_from_LA. 
The latitude feature does not correlate well with median_income, but a certain bin of latitude does.

c)
    Task 1:

        def createBucket(feature, featureString, buckets):
            tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
            feature, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
            training_examples[featureString], buckets))

        bucketized_latitude = createBucket(latitude, "latitude", 10)
        bucketized_housing_median_age = createBucket(housing_median_age, "housing_median_age", 10)
        bucketized_median_income = createBucket(median_income, "median_income", 10)
        bucketized_rooms_per_person = createBucket(rooms_per_person, "rooms_per_person", 10)

    Task 2:

        long_x_lat = tf.feature_column.crossed_column(
            set([bucketized_longitude, bucketized_latitude]), hash_bucket_size=1000)
