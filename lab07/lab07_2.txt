Exercise 7.2

a)  Numerical data is represented with integers and floats and can be depicted as a graph as this type of data is continuous.

b) Task 1:

    train_model(
        learning_rate=0.0005,
        steps=100,
        batch_size=5
    )

   Task 2:

    train_model(
        learning_rate=0.0005,
        steps=100,
        batch_size=100,
        input_feature="population"
    )

c) Hyper Parameters are the parameters given to the training function that dictate how the machine learns, 
how quickly and how precisely it zero's in on better solutions

There are not hard standards, but there are rules of thumb such as:
        -Increasing the learning_rate if the RMSE is not converging
        -Decreasing the learning_rate if the RMSE jumps around alot
        -Increasing batch_size until you can see a worse result
        -Low learning rate plus a high step size generally gives good results
