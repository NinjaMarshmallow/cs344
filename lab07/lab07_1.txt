Exercise 7.1
a)
        Pandas Exercise 1

        cities['Large Saint'] = cities['City name'].apply(lambda city: 'san' in city.lower()) & cities['Area square miles'].apply(lambda city: city > 50)
        print(cities)

        Pandas Exercise 2

        Allowing index values not in the original Data Frame gives the user the ability 
        to use another index method to show where there are missing values in the Data Frame.
        Also you don't have to worry about matching the different index methods perfectly.

b) Pandas is encapsulates many of the Numpy functionality into a couple functions, so that it can be learned quickly and used quickly. 
    It also pretty prints by default

c) Reindex would allow sorting by column and shuffling would allow for randomizing the data.
