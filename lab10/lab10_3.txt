Exercise 10.3

a) The confusion matrix for this example shows a dark diagonal line showing 
    that in general, it predicts very well. However, there are a few squares 
    off of the diagonal of correct predictions that are gray signally a 
    prediction error. This shows that the model has a bit of trouble telling 4's
    and 9's apart as well as  the difference between 5's and 3's. 


b) The Tensorflow network architecture is a Neural Network instead of a 
    linear regression network, so the difference in structure is that a 
    neural network provides multiple hidden layers to be able to model 
    non-linear relationships between variables.


c) 10 steps seems like random noise. 100 steps is slightly less random and by 1000 I can start to see partial numbers, but it's not very clear.
