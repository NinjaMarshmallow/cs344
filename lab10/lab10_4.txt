Exercise 10.4

a) The size of the cats and dogs datasets are both 25,000, but for this exercise only 2,000 of each are used.
    The dataset is an array of various images of cats and an array of various images of dogs.

b) It overfits a lot as shown by it being close to 100% accurate on the training set, 
    but only 70% on the validation set. I believe the example in class had a better score
    on the validation set.

c)It seems that the key features it looks for are pointy ears, whiskers, smaller squinty eyes 
    and a specific nose shape. All those definitely fit most types of cats. But it seems to overfit 
    to the picture where the cat is straight on in portrait view.
