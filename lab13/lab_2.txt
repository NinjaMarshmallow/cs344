Exercise 13.2

First Order Logic

a)

Facts:

1. There exists A, B such that on(A, B)
2. There exists B, C such that on(B, C)
3. There exists Table, C such that supports(Table, C)
4. For any X,Y supports(Y, X) => on(X, Y)
5. For any X,Y on(X, Y) => above(X, Y)
6. For any X,Y,Z (above(X, Y) && above(Y, Z)) => above(X, Z)

Proof. I will show that A is above the table.

Given the above facts.

Starting with Facts #3 and #4, supports(Table, C) implies that on(C, Table)
Then above(C, Table) (Fact #5)
Also above(B, C) (Fact #2 and #5)
Then above(B, Table) (Fact #6)
Also above(A, B) (Fact #1 and #5)

Then Finally above(A, Table) follows directly from the last two statments using Fact #6
