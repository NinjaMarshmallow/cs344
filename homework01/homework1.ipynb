    "Using Introspection as a method of modeling Artificial Intelligence processes could be useful, but there are probably better methods. Introspection use as a whole in the realm of Psychology has been in decline in recent history because of the rise of functionalism and behaviorism. Introspection is all about thinking about the way we think, and documenting that thinking process. Perhaps this could be used to program some decision making processes that are meant to mimic human flawed logic, but that is a niche use. The problem is that humans generally have little ability to truly know what they are thinking and more importantly why they are thinking certain things and most importantly humans are quite bad at explaining this in a way a computer could understand. I believe statistical methods like Bayes Theorem and other statistical models are a much better model for Artificial Intelligence processes.\n"

    "The Simulated Annealing solution seems to work better overall. With 5 towns or less, there is no difference as both find the solution, but since Simulated Annealing has the potential to jump across troughs that seperate local maxima, it is better at optimizing a shorter route. To fit the problem into the algorithm's frame work, the value function returns the distance as a negative integer so that the algorithm optimizes correctly. The Hill climbing algorithm gets stuck at local maximums too easily and there are many local maximums, so the chances of it finding a relatively high local maximum is pretty low as the number of towns grows."
