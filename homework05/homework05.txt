Exercise 7.2 from AI Text

(Adapted from Barwise and Etchemendy (1993).) Given the following, can you prove
that the unicorn is mythical? How about magical? Horned?
If the unicorn is mythical, then it is immortal, but if it is not mythical, then it is a
mortal mammal. If the unicorn is either immortal or a mammal, then it is horned.
The unicorn is magical if it is horned.

Seperated out:

1. If the unicorn is mythical, then it is immortal.
2. If it is not mythical, then it is a mortal mammal. 
3. If the unicorn is either immortal or a mammal, then it is horned.
4. The unicorn is magical if it is horned.

Since Â¬mythical | | mythical is a tautology, then the unicorn is either immortal or a mortal mammal by Facts #1 and #2.
Using Fact #3, it directly follows that the unicorn is horned.
By Fact #4, the unicorn is magical because it is horned.

So I have shown that the unicorn is both horned and magical. 
However, there are no facts that provide information on whether the unicorn is mystical or not.
There are no facts where being magical, horned, or a mammal implies mythical or not mythical.
