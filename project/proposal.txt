My project proposal is a neural network to correctly identify CAPTCHA images. 
I don't like doing them. I think it would be fun for the final project to have an algorithm 
pass a Turing Test. Since there are many different classifications that the CAPTCHA may 
prompt for, I think the first goal would be to get one classification working properly,
but the ultimate reach goal is to create multiple neural networks where the correct network
is chosen based on what object the CAPTCHA wants to be searched for among the images. I believe
we learned that the convolutional neural network worked well for image recognition, so I think
I will use that type of ML.

The technologies to be used are python specifically the keras library since that's what we've
been using for most of the current labs. I believe I would need some sort of javascript driver 
that finds the CAPTCHA on the page and then calls an ajax request to run the python script and 
get the result of the network.
