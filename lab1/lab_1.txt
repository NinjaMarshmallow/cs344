Exercise 1.1

    b.
        i. GPS is a Function
        ii. They are all lists
        iii. Yes, the main gps function calls achieve_all(),
                which calls achieve(),
                which calls apply_operator(),
                which calls achieve_all(), which starts the recursion
    d.
        i. It models the famous monkey and banana problem. The rules are the bananas are on the ceiling out of reach
            of the monkey even when standing on a chair, but waving a stick while on the chairwill knock the
            bananas down. No, the puzzle is slightly different in that the bananas are low enough for the monkey to
            grab, but the monkey must drop a ball first in order to grab the bananas

        ii. Chair Required
                push chair to the middle of the room
                climb on chair
            Door Required
                walk from door to middle of the room
            Ball Required
                drop ball
            Bananas Required
                grasp bananas
                eat bananas

        iii. The Acting Humanly definition fits this algorithm the most as it solves a very human logic problem
                that would take place in the real world and is not abstract like linear algebra
        iv. Yes, the monkey in the real world displays intelligence by using its environment to achieve its own goals
