Exercise 3.1

    a) All Algorithms find the solution to the solved puzzle
        Depth First Search fails on the easy, harder and hardest
        AC3 succeeds quickly on easy, fails on harder, and hardest
        Backtracking took about 30 seconds on the easy, but succeeded. Takes too long on harder and hardest
        Min Conflicts also took about 30 seconds on easy. Takes too long on harder and hardest
    
    b) Adding both parameters to Backtracking is best and allows the algorithm to finish all puzzles in under 1 second

Exercise 3.2

    a) 
        At N = 2000, Min Conflicts takes 3.54 seconds. At N = 500, it takes 0.22 seconds.
        At N = 200, AC3 takes 4.04 seconds, so it does not scale as well as Min Conflicts
        At N = 20, for vanilla Backtracking takes 2.5 seconds, and doesn't finish at 30,
        with the additional parameters it makes it to about 220 before failing to finish quickly
    
    b) Using both parameters is the best version of the Backtracking algorithm
