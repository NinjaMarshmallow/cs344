Exercise 11.2

a) Some biases in the data are shown by the various features. 
    For example, 2/3 of the dataset is male instead of the normal 
    50/50 split in the general population. Secondly, a vast majority 
    of the dataset are citizens of the United States and a vast majority 
    are white. So this is not representative of the general population.

b) The relationship feature has potential bias. There are 10x as many husbands 
    as wives in this dataset, so that either raises so interesting questions 
    about where the data was collected or women, particularly married women, 
    are severely underepresented in this dataset.

c) Done

d) There is a large disparity between white and black races looking at 
    the 50k a year feature. Whites are vastly overrepresented in the above 
    50k a year feature. Although it is difficult to really make any statistically 
    significant statement when the data is so skewed like this.
