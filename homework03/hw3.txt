Exercise 1

Compute the Information Gain of the Price attribute from the restaurant datatable

Gain(Price) = Entropy(Wait) - Remainder(Price)

            = 1.0 - (3/12 * Entropy($$$) + 2/12 * Entropy($$) + 7/12 * Entropy($)
            
            = 1.0 - (3/12 * -(lg(1/3) * 1/3 + lg(2/3) * 2/3) + 2/12 * 0 + 7/12 * -(lg(3/7) * 3/7 + lg(4/7) * 4/7) )
            
            = 1.0 - (3/12 * .9183 + 0 + 7/12 * .9851)
            
            = 1.0 - (0.804)
            
            = .196


Exercise 2

Simplify the XOR Mutlilayer Network by relaxing conventions of sequential densely connected networks. 

By removing a node, the network is no longer sequential as there are edges that go from the input 
nodes to both the hidden middle layer and the output node. The network is still densely connected 
though and removing edges to make the network no densely connected results in computation failure 
since the network becomes unbalanced or because a single layer network.

In the diagram below:

The center hidden node has an activation function requiring a threshold sum of 2 to send along 
to the output node. All edges have weights of 1 except for the edge from the center hidden node 
to the output node, which is -2. The Output node will output 1 if the threshold sum is more than 0.
